          I’m a passionate Computer Science student with a drive to turn ideas
          into innovative realities. With a keen interest in 3D modeling and
          software development, I’m always eager to dive deeper into data
          science and machine learning. When I’m not coding, you can usually
          find me at a local coffee shop fueling up for the next big project or
          unwinding with a good game. I believe in the power of lifelong
          learning (and a generous amount of coffee) to keep pushing me forward.
          Always open to connecting and sharing ideas—let’s collaborate!
